## 👋 About Me
Hi there! I’m **Peiran Lin (蔺培然)**, a fresh **PhD student** at the **School of Life Sciences, Westlake University**.  

Right now, I’m diving into science at the [**Artificial Intelligence & Computational Biology Lab (Zeng Jianyang)**](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/jianyang-zeng.html),  
while rotating through the [**Cell Biology Lab (Prof. Hongtao Yu)**](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/hongtao-yu.html) and the [**AI Research & Innovation Lab (Prof. Ziqing Li)**](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/stan-zq-li.html).  

🎓 I got my bachelor’s degree from **Shandong University**, majoring in both **Biology** and **Computer Science & Technology**.  

🔬 My current research passions include:  
- Designing **AI algorithms for single-cell spatial omics**  
- Building **large language models for cellular perturbations** (a.k.a. *virtual organs*)  
- Exploring **bioinformatics, toxicology, and microbiology**
