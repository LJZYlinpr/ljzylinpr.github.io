We report two novel Gram-stain-negative strains (*Zhengella sedimenti* sp. nov., *Phycobacter sedimenti* sp. nov.) isolated from the coastal sediment of Weihai, China. Using polyphasic taxonomy, whole-genome sequencing, and metabolic pathway analysis, we confirm their taxonomic placement and infer ecological functions.
- **Isolation & taxonomy:** coastal sediment; polyphasic classification (morphology, physiology, 16S rRNA phylogeny).
- **Genomics:** pathways for aromatic compound degradation and algal symbiosis suggested by key operons.
- **Significance:** expands diversity within related genera and informs the metabolic ecology of coastal microbiota.
