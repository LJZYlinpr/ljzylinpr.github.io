We present a **virtual counselor** pipeline combining **EEG emotion detection** (feature extraction, elicitation protocols, classifiers) with **LLM-based** therapeutic prompting. The paper outlines two orchestration paradigms—**direct suggestion** and **prompt method**—and discusses limitations and future directions towards real-time assistive systems.
- **EEG modules:** emotion models, datasets, elicitation, feature engineering, classifiers.
- **LLM modules:** dialogue control, safety scaffolding, and task prompting.
