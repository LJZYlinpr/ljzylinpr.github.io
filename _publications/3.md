We evaluate how **eco-corona** (biomolecule coatings formed in seawater) modifies the physicochemical properties of MNPs and enhances visual toxicity in *Oryzias melastigma*.
- **Findings:** eye malformation, retinal histopathology, increased apoptosis, and downregulated vision-related gene expression are more severe with eco-corona–modified MNPs.
- **Implication:** environmental transformations (eco-corona/plastisphere) must be considered in ecological risk assessment of MNPs.
