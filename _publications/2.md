We perform a **co-exposure** study integrating behavior assays, biochemical endpoints, and gene expression analyses to evaluate interactive toxicity of **MNPs + TPT** during early development in *Oryzias melastigma*.
- **Behavior:** locomotor and lightâ€“dark preference alterations indicate neurotoxicity.
- **Biochemical:** oxidative stress markers and AChE activity disruption.
- **Molecular:** differential expression of neuronal and stress-response genes.
